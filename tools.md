## .README files

.README files are extremely important to have. They should provide all the information necessary for a new developer to jump into the project and start coding and deploying to staging/production. Here's a high-level boilerplate:

```
#Name of project
Short description

#Team
Name, Role, Email

#Setup
How to setup local
How to sync up local database from staging/production
How to sync up files from staging/production

#Run
How to run it locally
How to run it in docker

#Deploy
Deploy to Staging
Staging Link
Deploy to Production
Production Link

#Routine tasks
How to add translations
How to create new routes

#ACF workflow (wordpress)
Link to wiki
```

## .editorconfig

An [`.editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org/) file can be used to ensure code is formatted the same way when working with multiple contributors.  Things such as `tab` or `space` indentation, and trimming whitespace are the major reason for using this.  To get started, you need to:

  1. Add an `.editorconfig` file to your project
  2. Configure your editor

### Add an `.editorconfig` file to your project
Generally this file should be added to the root of your project, alongside `.gitignore`.

This example is from the [Yeoman AngularJS Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular).  

```
root = true

[*]
# Change these settings to your own preference
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2

# We recommend you to keep these unchanged
end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true

[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = false
```

For projects that require you to use `tab` characters for indentation (Wordpress), can add the following link to your `.editorconfig` file:

```
indent_style = tab
```

### Configuration with your editor
There are plugins for [Vim](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim#readme), [Sublime Text](https://github.com/sindresorhus/editorconfig-sublime#readme), [Textmate](https://github.com/Mr0grog/editorconfig-textmate#readme) and [a few others](http://editorconfig.org/#download).  Once you have the plugin installed, things should just take over.  To test if it is working, add the example `.editorconfig` file above to your project, open up a file within the project and add a few spaces at the end of a line.  After saving the file, the trailing spaces should go away.

## Preprocessors

Things we use preprocessors for:

  - Concatenate and minify javascript
  - Lint javascript
  - Create custom modernizr builds
  - Compile sass
  - Create SVG sprites

We have two different preprocessors boilerplate:

* [Gruntyplate](https://github.com/domain7/gruntyplate) for Grunt which is the one we currently use on most projects
* [Sevenpack](https://github.com/domain7/sevenpack) for Webpack which will eventually move to



## Prettier

[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) is an opinionated code formatter with support for:
* JavaScript, including [ES2017](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md)
* [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/)
* [Flow](https://flow.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* CSS, [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), and [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com)
* [JSON](http://json.org/)
* [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)

The reasoning behind Prettier is well described in the project's readme [Why Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/blob/master/README.md#why-prettier).

There's a number of ways you can use Prettier:
- [Editor plugin](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#editor-integration) (recommended)
- [Command line](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#cli)
- [Pre-commit hook](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#pre-commit-hook)
- [Node module](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#api)

Prettier has built-in [options](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#options) or it can integrated with the existing [ESLint config](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#eslint).


## lint-staged

Linting makes more sense when running before committing your code. By doing that you can ensure no errors are going into repository and enforce code style. But running a lint process on a whole project could be slow on a large project and linting results can be irrelevant. Ultimately you only want to lint files that will be committed.

### Installation and setup

1. `npm install --save-dev lint-staged husky`
1. Install and setup your linters just like you would do normally. Add appropriate `.eslintrc`, `.stylelintrc`, etc.
1. Update your `package.json` like this:
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "precommit": "lint-staged"
    },
    "lint-staged": {
      "*.js": ["eslint --fix", "git add"]
    }
  }
  ```

Now change a few files, `git add` some of them to your commit and try to `git commit` them.
